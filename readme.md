<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


<img src='/assets/img/comparison.png'>

I¬¥ve been studing HTML CSS and JS for about a year now and decided to post some exercises here so you can follow along my progress. 

This was part of a challenge I did to myself so it is not the most polished version it can get and there¬¥re probably a lot of improvements that can be done to the structure and of course the responsiveness (Work in progress)

### Built With
This project was built using just HTML5 and CSS3.
